# FrameDetector_code
its a project when i use deep learning,and python code to detect bad frames in viedo remove it and generate a good frames to correct the video.

One day i made a short movie with the canon XHA1 magnetoscope, after few weeks when i started to convert a video from a miniDV cassette to my PC, using a videocard, the cassete obvioulsy was deteriorted, i cant shoot the scene again, so i lose some frames , in important scene, then i let the movie and the project away.
after i learn deep learning and data science, i think that i can fix the bad the probleme.
in this project you will find all i do to fix the probleme,
i put it in github, because looking for somebody can devlope the code and propose more powerfale algorithme.
